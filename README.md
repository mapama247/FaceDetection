# FaceDetection

Implementation of the AdaBoost algoithm in MATLAB for face detection in images.

The algorithm sequentially trains a number of so-called weak classifiers that are combined into one strong classifier.

The classifier is able to distinguish face images from other images using Haar features.

Data: A large number of face/non-face 24x24 images.
