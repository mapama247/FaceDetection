# FaceDetection (Boosting)

MATLAB implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm for face detection in images.

The algorithm sequentially trains a number of weak classifiers that are combined into one strong classifier.

The final classifier is able to distinguish face images from other images using Haar features.

Data: A large number of face/non-face 24x24 images.
